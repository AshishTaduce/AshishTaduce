# 👋 Hey there, I'm Ashish!

Civil engineer turned code wizard from the beautiful city of lakes, Bhopal! When I'm not making pixels dance across screens, you'll find me deep in podcast rabbit holes or dominating fast-paced shooters (fair warning: my reflexes are questionable but my enthusiasm is unmatched).

I build stuff that works even when the internet doesn't! My offline-first Flutter apps will sync your data even if you're coding from a cave or the middle of nowhere. Trust me, I've tested this in places where carrier pigeons deliver faster than 4G.

## 🔥 What I'm All About

I love turning caffeine into code and impossible deadlines into shipped products. My superpower? Making Flutter apps so smooth you could ice skate on them, even when your connection is having an existential crisis.

## 🛠️ My Tech Toybox

```
Flutter & Dart      : My ride-or-die toolkit. We've been through a lot together.
React & JavaScript  : For when I want to make browsers sweat a little.
GetX                : Because state management should be less painful than stepping on Legos.
Bluetooth Integration: Yes, I can make your app talk to hardware. Magic? Maybe. Coffee? Definitely.
Offline Support     : Making apps work where internet fears to tread.
```

## 🏆 Cool Stuff I've Built

### 📱 Consumer App with Gamification
Built a spin-the-tree game that boosted engagement by 30%. Not to brag, but I made trees cool again.

### 📦 Warehouse Management with Bluetooth Scales
Connected Flutter apps to weight machines with 99.9% accuracy. The 0.1% was when someone put their coffee mug on the scale.

### 🧠 Dynamic UI Without Redeployment
Created an app that changes its appearance without updates. It's like giving your app a wardrobe change without asking it to restart.

### 📊 Analytics That Actually Tell You Something Useful
Implemented frameworks that increased conversion by 22%. That's like turning 5 users into 6.1 users (the 0.1 user is still making up their mind).

## 🚀 Current Adventures

Working on making apps that don't just work, but work *beautifully* even when everything else is failing. If your app can survive a user with 2% battery and spotty connection in an elevator, you've done something right.

## 💭 Philosophy

> "If it works offline, it works anywhere."
> 
> "Bluetooth should be simple. It rarely is. I make it simple anyway."
>
> "The best code is invisible to users – they just know the app works like magic."

## 🎮 When Not Coding

- Hunting for the perfect podcast episode
- Perfecting my headshot ratio in FPS games
- Explaining to non-tech friends why my app works when theirs doesn't
- Finding creative ways to make database queries more exciting than they should be
