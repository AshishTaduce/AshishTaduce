Some of the projects done by me in the past:
## Tic Tac Toe Game

> A simple tic tac toe game made in Flutter, with focus on encapsulation of logic and design, i.e. the same logic can be used to play the game on console, or be quickly shifted to another UI design choice, thus making components more future proof.
Another priority was usage of custom painter to design a well-animated looking background for the app.

## Movie Search

> A **React** web app, using **TMDb** api to search for the latest movies, shows, web series, or to find and  remember the movie you've been thinking to watch on the upcoming weekend, but can't remember, either from the part of the title, or the actor
> Lots of effort were put during the development and planning phase to ensure a solid and robust state management, having a minimilistic design to avoid confusion, and making sure that error of each sort is handled properly, if any occured.

## CRM Website and companion app

> A customer record management **React** app, with a companion app developed in **Flutter**.
The database used is a **MongoDb** databse, with scripting for backend done on **ExpressJS**.
Functionallity present include adding new customer, deleting customers, and undoing deletes within a time span of deletion.
Absolute priorities were to ensure proper security protocols were followed throught out, userdata and password are encrypted, and the companion app follows the same rules as the web app.
