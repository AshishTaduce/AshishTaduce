# Portfolio

Some of the projects done by me in the past:


## McLaren Times

> A **Flutter** news app, which brings to you the tech news and articles from round the globe, with the functionality of suggesting changes to title or image, thus improving the articles for all. A news app by the people, for the people, from the people.

**Demo Video**

>API functions are witten in JavaScript and run on FireBase Cloud Functions.
Database used is FireBase FireStore and AWS.
Major roles during the development were troubleshooting of web crawler, debugging the image fetching issues, making the front end pixel perfect, managing the state of the app during the voting process, writing and maintenance of cloud functions for submission of user suggestion, voting, and removal of suggestions NSFW to count a few

## Tic Tac Toe Game

> A simple tic tac toe game made in Flutter, with focus on encapsulation of logic and design, i.e. the same logic can be used to play the game on console, or be quickly shifted to another UI design choice, thus making components more future proof.

**Demo Video**

## Movie Search

> A **React** web app, using **TMDb** api to search for the latest movies, shows, web series, or to find and  remember the movie you've been thinking to watch on the upcoming weekend, but can't remember, either from the part of the title, or the actor
> Lots of effort were put during the development and planning phase to ensure a solid and robust state management, having a minimilistic design to avoid confusion, and making sure that error of each sort is handled properly, if any occured.

>The database used is a **MongoDb** databse, with scripting for backend done on **ExpressJS**.
Functionallity present include adding new customer, deleting customers, and undoing deletes within a time span of deletion.
Absolute priorities were to ensure proper security protocols were followed throught out, userdata and password are encrypted, and the companion app follows the same rules as the web app.
